[\fIMODE\fR] [\fIOPTION\fR]... 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clarc
is a utility that synchronizes local file system folder to Amazon S3. Only files that were changed/added since last 
.B clarc 
invocation are uploaded.

.B clarc 
keeps track of changes by storing file metadata in a small local database. It possible to quickly rebuild the database from Amazon S3.

.SH MODE

.B clarc
must be one or both of the following. If you specify both, then 
.B rebuild 
is done first. This is the most failsafe mode of operation.
