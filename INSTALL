Build on Linux
==============

clarc is using Grand Central Dispatch and C Blocks to use all available CPU cores, 
network bandwidth and disk speed. In order to build clarc on Linux you will need 
the clang C/C++ compiler and the following libraries installed:

 * libdispatch
 * libcurl with SSL support
 * libxml2

On a modern Linux distribution this is all available out of the box. 
For instance, on Ubuntu 12 do:

      sudo apt-get install libblocksruntime-dev libdispatch clang

Then simply make.


Build on OS X
=============

OS X has GCD and clang available by default, but you must have Xcode (or Xcode 
command-line tools) installed.

First, you have to download the latest SQLite source code (pick the second link, 
the tar.gz). Unpack it, then run:

      ./configure --enable-threadsafe
      make

After it's done, copy .libs/sqlite.a into clarc/ source code folder.

Then simply make.


Manpage
=======

      sudo cp src/clarc.1 /usr/local/man/man1/

(or whatever).
